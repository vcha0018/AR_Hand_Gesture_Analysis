# Hand Gesture Analysis
The main purpose of this application is to analyse captured gesture dataset and provide similarity measurement score for same type of gestures. <br>
This application uses three types of dissimilarity function to compute dissimilarity matric. <br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Euclidean Distance
    <ul>
      <li>
        It measures the distance between two vectors in the given space at the same time.
      </li>
  </li>
  •	Dynamic Time Wrapping
     o	It measures dissimilarity or calculates the distance between the two-time series with different length.
  •	Modified Hausdorff
     o	It measures distance between two matrices in terms of how far they are or how much closer.
<br>
Dissimilarity matric further used to compute Consensus of the input gesture type. <br>
The Consensus show which gesture pair is similar or gives similarity of various gesture type performed by different person after applying tolerance factor. <br>
